## What it is about
This is just a repository of a click prototype for the pitch of the [hackathon #wirvsvirushack 2020](https://wirvsvirushackathon.devpost.com/?ref_content=featured&ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover) from Germany.
Feel free to work with or on. We welcome any support.

## The problem
Our health system will reach its limits in the coming weeks: Aids and staff will become scarce if we do not distribute them in a targeted manner! This would result in overcrowded hospitals, overwhelmed doctors and dying patients.
 
Our hospitals face two challenges:
1. Who can help me quickly with scarce aids?
2. How do I find personnel to fight Corona?

We address the challenges:
1. How can medical aids be distributed sensibly and dynamically between hospitals?
2. How do you bring hospitals and available staff / helpers together?

## Developed solution: "Hospital Connect"
Hospital Connect is an exchange platform for aids and staff. It connects:
- Hospitals with hospitals and
- Hospitals with helpers (such as doctors, medical students, nurses, paramedics, facility managers, etc.)

Hospital Connect offers 4 main functions:
1. Hospitals can report their need for aids and staff
2. Hospitals can see available stocks and staff support
3. Helpers can offer their help
4.Hospitals that need help may include helpers such as Doctors, nurses, logisticians, ect. Find

Hospital Connect is a platform / app on which at best all clinics - i.e. cross-carrier or alternatively differentiated according to different carriers and groups (in order not to completely undo the market) to their resources. This means both human and material resources. Both bottlenecks and free capacities
can be viewed by any participating clinic. For example, if Clinic A needs staff for the night, Clinic B (which is not too far away) can send someone. At the same time, Clinic B may need something else that Clinic A or C can do. In a few days, clinic A can help out clinic B or C, etc.

## Added value from Hospital Connect
- Clinics can display their stocks of medical aids in the form of a traffic light system
other clinics communicate and exchange them with each other.
- Clinics can report bottlenecks via the app and at other clinics,
Ask volunteers or freelancers for staff.
- Users of the app get an overview of the clinics with a direct contact person
with information about their shortages or surpluses.

## Ideas for further development:
- There may have to be incentives for users to offer their support.
- A chat could be built into the application so that the clinics can exchange information directly.
- In order to speed up the exchange of tools, a direct reservation could take place via the application.
- Aids could also be ordered directly via the application and a delivery service could be integrated.
- There could also be a best practice page in which clinics exchange information about corona patients, how to deal with them and how to care for them.

## Implementation challenges
- Identification of the contact person in the hospital is challenging and not immediately clear
- Reaching the critical mass of users is a challenge and necessary for a successful exchange

Achievements we are proud of
- Our prototype works
- Strategic partnerships have been identified

## What we learned
- Centralizing communication and targeting aid delivery can help overcome the corona crisis.
- There are many great initiatives and volunteers dedicated to fighting COCID-19. A platform can really help here to match this potential with needs.

## What's next for Hospital Connect
- Establishment of partnerships such as: Federal Association of Medical Students, Ministry of Health, State Medical Associations
- Launch of the platform

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
